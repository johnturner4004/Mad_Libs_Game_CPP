# Mad Libs Game

## Description

This is just a mad libs game built using C++

### Prerequisites

The application itself should run in a mac terminal. If you would like to edit the code and compile it yourself you just need a C++ compiler. I used the C/C++ Compiler extension for VSCode(link below). You may need to follow the instructions in the extension's description to install a compiler application for it to use

- [C/C++ Compile Run](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=danielpinto8zz6.c-cpp-compile-run)

## Installation

After installing the extension while VS Code, open the .cpp file and press <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>. This will both compile the code then run it in VSCode's terminal
## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler (see above)
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file in a terminal if you alreqdy are not there
3. Type in the filename and press <kbd>return</kbd>
